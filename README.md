# Metrocar - Funnel Analysis

## Introduction

Metrocar is a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft). Metrocar's business model is based on a
platform that connects riders with drivers through a mobile application. Metrocar is an
intermediary between riders and drivers, providing a user-friendly platform to connect them and
facilitate the ride-hailing process.

Stakeholders had asked the data analysis team to analyze Metrocarâ€™s data and identify areas
for improvement and optimization. For example, Metrocar wants to analyze the percentage of
users who download the app but do not complete the registration process, or the percentage of
users who request a ride but cancel before the driver arrives.

Funnel analysis was used to identify where users drop off or convert, helping to ultimately
increase desired outcomes, such as sales, sign-ups, or conversions. It is widely used in
e-commerce, marketing, and product development to drive growth and revenue.
